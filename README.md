# Custom Printf Function Project

This project is a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language. The function is designed to handle various conversion specifiers and produce output accordingly. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program's curriculum.

## Project Overview

The custom printf function, named `_printf`, is developed to handle the following conversion specifiers:

- `%c`: for printing characters
- `%s`: for printing strings
- `%%`: for printing the percent symbol

The project is organized into several tasks, each involving the implementation of additional functionalities and more complex conversion specifiers. The project follows the requirements and guidelines outlined in the project brief provided by the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Files and Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and test cases for the custom `_printf` function.
- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.
- Other source files as required for the project tasks.

## How to Use

To use the custom `_printf` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the `main.h` header file in your C program.
2. Call the `_printf` function with the appropriate format string and arguments.
3. Compile your program with the required flags as specified in the project guidelines.

## Project Tasks

The project is divided into multiple tasks, each building upon the previous one and adding more complex features to the custom `_printf` function. Each task involves the implementation of specific conversion specifiers and functionalities.
